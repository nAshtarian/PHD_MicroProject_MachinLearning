# PHD_MicroProject_MachinLearning

<h3>Python Machine Learning by Example - Third Edition </h3>

A comprehensive guide to get you up to speed with the latest developments of practical machine learning with Python and upgrade your understanding of machine learning (ML) algorithms and techniques


<h3>Building a Movie Recommendation Engine with Naïve Bayes</h3>

As promised, in this chapter, we will kick off our supervised learning journey with machine learning classification, and specifically, binary classification. The goal of the chapter is to build a movie recommendation system. It is a good starting point to learn classification from a real-life example—movie streaming service providers are already doing this, and we can do the same. You will learn the fundamental concepts of classification, including what it does and its various types and applications, with a focus on solving a binary classification problem using a simple, yet powerful, algorithm, Naïve Bayes. Finally, the chapter will demonstrate how to fine-tune a model, which is an important skill that every data science or machine learning practitioner should learn.

We will go into detail on the following topics:

    What is machine learning classification?
    Types of classification
    Applications...


<h3>About Project </h3>

This project will focus on predicting heart disease using neural networks. Based on attributes such as blood pressure, cholestoral levels, heart rate, and other characteristic attributes, patients will be classified according to varying degrees of coronary artery disease. This project will utilize a dataset of 303 patients and distributed by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence is going to have a dramatic impact on the health field; as a result, familiarizing yourself with the data processing techniques appropriate for numerical health data and the most widely used algorithms for classification tasks is an incredibly valuable use of your time! In this tutorial, we will do exactly that.

We will be using some common Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Furthermore, for the machine learning side of this project, we will be using sklearn and keras. Import these libraries using the cell below to ensure you have them correctly installed.

  Here is the URL of dataset:

http:////archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

This dataset contains patient data concerning heart disease diagnosis that was collected at several locations around the world. There are 76 attributes, including age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholestoral levels, echocardiogram data, exercise habits, and many others. To data, all published studies using this data focus on a subset of 14 attributes - so we will do the same. More specifically, we will use the data collected at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.

To import the necessary data, we will use pandas' built in read_csv() function.
